# Sentiment Analyzer Twitter


## Overview

This project focuses on sentiment analysis and online reputation monitoring using machine learning models and MLOps methodologies. It leverages fine-tuning of pre-trained models to analyze social media data and automatically classify user sentiments as positive, neutral, or negative. The system includes CI/CD pipelines, deployment strategies, and continuous monitoring tools to help businesses proactively manage and improve their reputation online.
## Features

- **Fine-tuning of Pre-trained Models:** Adapt state-of-the-art models (e.g., RoBERTa) for domain-specific sentiment analysis.
- **Automated Sentiment Analysis:** Process social media text data to detect sentiment trends in real-time.
- **CI/CD Pipelines:** Automated workflows for training, testing, and deploying models.
- **Continuous Monitoring:** Integration with monitoring tools to track model performance and sentiment shifts over time.
- **Scalable Deployment:** Options for deploying models on platforms like HuggingFace or custom infrastructure.
